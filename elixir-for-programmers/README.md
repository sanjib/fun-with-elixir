# Elixir for Programmers

Personal study notes and code for the course by Dave Thomas [Elixir for Programmers](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers)

## Stack

- BEAM: the virtual machine (for example the JVM)
- OTP: collection of middleware, libraries and tools
- Erlang: the language (Elixir is transformed into Erlang to run on BEAM)
- Hex: package manager
- Mix: build tool
- IEx: interactive tool (REPL)
- Elixir: the language

## Links

- [Installing Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
- [Package manager Hex](https://hex.pm/), install `mix local.hex`

## Quotes

- Our main tools are functional composition and pattern matching.
- Composition means chaining together functions so that the output of one becomes the input of the next.
- Pattern matching lets you write different versions of the same function. This is similar to the idea of overloaded methods in some OO languages.
- When you're just starting out with Elixir, try to make yourself use pipelines all the time. A good way to remind yourself is to try not to use local variables. You won't always succeedâ€”sometimes you just need to use them. But thinking about eliminating them will help you think in terms of transformations and pipelines.

## Notes

- Do we have elixir?

```console
> elixir -v
Erlang/OTP 21 [erts-10.3] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1]

Elixir 1.10.0 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 21)
```

- Install Hex `mix local.hex`
- Run IEx `iex`, on windows use `iex --werl`

### IEx

```console
> h IO.puts             # help for IO.puts
> h String.trim         # help for String.trim
> v 1                   # value for step 1
> (v 1) / 9             # divide value for step 1 by 9
> #iex:break            # break out of an entry
> r [module-name]       # recompile module
> c "lib/[src-file]"    # compile source file
```

- run iex from inside mix project directory `iex -S mix`

### mix

```console
mix new [project-name]  # create new project
mix                     # compile
mix run                 # run
mix run -e [mod].[fun]  # run mod.fun
mix help                # help
mix help run            # help for mix run
iex -S mix              # starts iex & runs default task
```
